# CIS-40

CIS 40 - Lab assignment 2
Due 2/6/23 at 11:59pm
Topics: types, branches


A. For each program that you turn in, create 2 lines of comments at the top of your .py file  (5pts)
- First line:  your full name
- Second line:  a short description of what the program does

B.  Write a Python program (10 pts) that will report car insurance costs. Prompt the user to enter age and prompt 
user to answer whether user has ever been in an accident in the last 2 years with "yes" or "no" strings. Using 
branches (if/else), print out the insurance cost based on the following circumstances:
- Between 16 and 25 years old, no accident:  $3000
- Between 16 and 25 years old, accident: $3500
- Between 26 and 45 years old, no accident:  $2000
- Between 26 and 45 years old, accident: $2500
- 46 years old and up, no accident: $1200
- 46 years old and up, accident: $1500 

C. Within the same Python file (10 pts), please prompt the user to enter 3 car prices. Store them in separate variables. 
Once you have the three variables:
- Create a list with all 3 variables
- Print out the maximum cost from the numbers in the list
- Print out the minimum cost from the numbers in the list
- Print out the difference between the maximum and minimum cost
- Print out the total cost of all three cars
- Store the previous four pieces of information in a dictionary, where the key is text (i.e. "maximum cost") and the value 
is the amount you calculated. Your dictionary should have four keys related to the max cost, min cost, difference, and 
total cost. Then, print out the dictionary.
